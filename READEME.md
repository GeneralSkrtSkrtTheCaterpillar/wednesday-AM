# Intro to jQuery effects
###### Today you will get to use jQuery to make your webpages have some super cool effects.

#### Let's get started:
* Open up the folder and look through all the files `index.html` `script.js` `style.css`.
* Open up the `index.html` on a webpage 

#### Some CSS Review:
* In `style.css` write code to make the background color of the whole page something pretty using a [hex color](https://www.google.com/search?q=hex+color+picker&oq=hex+color+picker&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.2831j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).
* Put a header above the container, it should say something like "Hidden Messages"
* Use a set the body `font-family` to a [google font](https://fonts.google.com/).
* Make the background color of the container a transparent color using `rgba()`

#### Okay, let's get into the jQuery:
* Make sure you have the chrome developer tools console open on your webpage
* Answer the question on `script.js`
* After the `$(document).ready(function(){ ` write `console.log("page is loaded")`, then refresh the page and look your message in the console.
* If the previous step worked, you're ready to get down to the real business.
* Using the jQuery `hide()` and/or `show()` functions to make the page only display the words "YOU ARE SMART"
* Now display "WE LOVE TO CODE"

####Fancy things up a bit:
* Look up [jQuery's `fadeOut()` and/or `fadeIn()`](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jQuery+fadeOut()) functions to make the messages more slowly appear
* [REMEMBER Google is your friend](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jQuery+fadeOut())
